				of attendance taking and client payment
				processing.

				<br />
				While you could use several mobile apps
				to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is
				the all-in-one solution to meet your
				“on-location” fitness class needs.
				AnywhereFitness makes it painless for
				Instructors and Clients alike to hold
				and attend Fitness classes wherever they
